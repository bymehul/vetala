# Code Security Audit Capabilities

OWASP 4-source integrated code security audit system for universal codebase analysis.

## Knowledge Sources

- **OWASP ASVS 5.0.0**: 345 verification requirements across 17 security domains (L1/L2/L3)
- **OWASP API Security Top 10 2023**: 10 API-specific risk categories with code-level indicators
- **OWASP CheatSheet Series**: 109 practical secure coding cheat sheets for remediation guidance
- **OWASP WSTG (Web Security Testing Guide)**: 12 testing categories with 120+ test scenarios

## Source Roles

| Source | Role | Usage |
|--------|------|-------|
| ASVS 5.0.0 | Verification requirements baseline | Defines what to check — structured requirements per domain |
| API Security Top 10 2023 | Risk taxonomy | Defines what to look for — API-specific threat patterns |
| CheatSheet Series | Implementation guidance | Defines how to fix — secure coding patterns and practices |
| WSTG | Test methodology | Defines how to verify — concrete test scenarios per vulnerability |

## Domains

- **Input Handling** (V1, V2, V5): Encoding, sanitization, injection prevention, validation, file handling
- **Authentication & Session** (V6, V7, V9, V10): Auth mechanisms, session management, token handling, OAuth/OIDC
- **Authorization** (V8): Object-level, function-level, property-level access control
- **Cryptography** (V11, V12): Storage encryption, key management, TLS configuration
- **API Security** (V4, V17): REST/GraphQL/WebSocket/WebRTC security, rate limiting, resource consumption
- **Data Protection** (V14): Sensitive data exposure, privacy controls, client-side data
- **Configuration** (V13, V16): Security headers, CORS, error handling, logging, deployment hardening
- **Secure Coding** (V3, V15): Web frontend security, architecture patterns, defensive coding, concurrency safety

## Input Contract

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Codebase path** | Yes | The current workspace or repository the agent is operating in. Defaults to the active codebase; users may narrow scope to specific directories or files (e.g., `src/auth/`, `api/controllers/`) |
| **Audit level** | No | ASVS verification level (default: **L2**). See level definitions below |
| **Focus areas** | No | Security domains to prioritize. See focus area catalog below |
| **Tech context** | No | Language, framework, or architecture notes for targeted analysis |

### Audit Levels (OWASP ASVS 5.0.0)

| Level | Target Application | Requirements | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **L1** | All applications | ~86 | Essential baseline — covers critical vulnerabilities that are typically exploitable and must be addressed in every application (e.g., SQL injection, OS command injection, basic auth checks) |
| **L2** | Applications handling sensitive data (PII, financial, health) | ~230 | Standard security — includes L1 plus defense-in-depth controls such as SSRF protection, template injection prevention, secure session management, and proper cryptographic usage |
| **L3** | Mission-critical systems (banking, healthcare, military, infrastructure) | ~345 | Comprehensive defense — includes L1+L2 plus advanced controls such as formula injection prevention, full input canonicalization, and exhaustive cryptographic verification |

### Focus Area Catalog

| Focus Area | Domains | Example Checks |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **authentication** | V6, V7, V9, V10 | Password storage, MFA, OAuth/OIDC flow, credential rotation |
| **authorization** | V8 | Object-level (BOLA), function-level, property-level access control |
| **injection** | V1, V2 | SQLi, XSS, command injection, LDAP/XPath injection, template injection, XXE |
| **cryptography** | V11, V12 | Weak algorithms, key management, TLS configuration, secret storage |
| **api-security** | V4, V17 | Rate limiting, resource consumption, REST/GraphQL/WebSocket security |
| **session** | V7, V9, V10 | Token handling, session fixation, cookie attributes, JWT validation, CSRF |
| **file-handling** | V5 | Path traversal, unrestricted upload, file type validation, storage security |
| **data-protection** | V14 | Sensitive data exposure, privacy controls, client-side data leakage |
| **configuration** | V13, V16 | Security headers, CORS, error handling, logging, deployment hardening |
| **secure-coding** | V3, V15 | Frontend security, concurrency safety, architecture patterns, defensive coding |

## Preconditions

- Codebase is accessible and readable
- Agent has file search and read capabilities
- If codebase structure cannot be determined, the agent reports limitations in the audit output

## Core Capabilities

- **Codebase Reconnaissance**: Identifies technology stack, frameworks, entry points, and security-relevant file areas
- **Domain-Scoped Analysis**: Systematically audits code across all 8 security domains
- **ASVS Requirement Verification**: Checks code against applicable ASVS 5.0.0 requirements at the specified level
- **Vulnerability Pattern Detection**: Identifies known vulnerable code patterns from the integrated knowledge base
- **Cross-Source Correlation**: Maps findings to ASVS requirements, API Top 10 risks, CheatSheet guidance, and WSTG test IDs
- **Severity Classification**: Rates findings as Critical/High/Medium/Low with evidence and confidence
- **Remediation Guidance**: Provides concrete fix patterns sourced from CheatSheet Series
- **Structured Report Generation**: Produces a comprehensive Markdown audit report

## Audit Workflow

```
1. Reconnaissance    → Identify stack, structure, entry points
2. Scope Definition  → Select applicable ASVS domains and level
3. Domain Analysis   → Audit each security domain systematically
4. Finding Synthesis → Deduplicate, correlate across sources, assign severity
5. Remediation Map   → Attach fix patterns per finding
6. Report Generation → Produce structured Markdown report
```

## Output Contract

The audit produces a Markdown report containing:

- **Executive Summary**: Overall risk posture, critical findings count, audit scope
- **Findings Table**: Each finding with severity, ASVS ID, CWE, evidence, and remediation
- **Domain Reports**: Per-domain detailed analysis with code references
- **Remediation Roadmap**: Prioritized fix recommendations
- **Audit Metadata**: Scope, level, limitations, methodology notes

## Severity Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Critical** | Exploitable vulnerability with direct security impact (RCE, SQLi, auth bypass, data breach) |
| **High** | Significant security weakness requiring prompt remediation (broken access control, weak crypto, SSRF) |
| **Medium** | Security concern with conditional exploitability (missing headers, verbose errors, weak validation) |
| **Low** | Defense-in-depth improvement or best practice deviation (logging gaps, minor config issues) |
| **Info** | Observation or recommendation with no direct security impact |
